<!--
**joshmeador/joshmeador** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on finishing my education and beginning a career in the Aerospace industry.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code in C and looking to learn more about anything Aerospace related.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love watching sports and learning new things. I love learning and diversifying my knowledge as best as I can.
